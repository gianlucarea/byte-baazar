# Byte Baazar
Welcome to my Byte Baazar repository! This repo is structured into two three main sections: **rust-lang** and **golang** and **python**. 
The repo is a full of projects made in three different language and many technology I've created to expand my horizons and basically learn. 
The Readme is updated after each project is finished!

### [Grrs ðŸ§¨](./rust-lang/grrs)
This Rust CLI project called Grrs covers ownership, borrowing, `fs::File`, and `io::BufRead`. It implements basic `cat`, `grep`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` commands.
