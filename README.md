# Rust Baazar ü¶Ä
Welcome to my **Rust Bazaar** repository! This space is dedicated entirely to exploring and mastering **Rust**. Over time, I've created **4 projects** in Rust, each aiming to enhance my understanding of the language and its rich ecosystem.

## **Repository Goal**

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a personal learning log, showcasing my progress and development in Rust. Each project is a small step in my journey, expanding my horizons with every line of code. With each new project, I am able to explore different Rust features, libraries, and tools that make Rust a powerful language for modern software development.

## **Projects ü¶Ä**

### [Grrs üß®](./grrs)
This Rust CLI project called Grrs covers ownership, borrowing, `fs::File`, and `io::BufRead`. It implements basic `cat`, `grep`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` commands.

### [Runestone üóø](./runestone)
This project, Runestone, is a minimal Rust web server built with Axum and Tokio for asynchronous programming with CRUD operations. It integrates PostgreSQL.
